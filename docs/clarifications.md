Clarifications
-------------

If this was a brief from a client these are some points I would follow up with them to get further clarification. I have also included the assumptions I made in the face of my ambiguity.

Part of this ambiguity maybe due to my limited French skills.

Required Questions
------------------

In general there was no mention of which questions were required. I took this to mean, all questions are assumed required unless stated to be conditional on other answers.

Survey 1 - Q5.
--------------

*"Q5 : [s'affiche si Q3 répondu] 
Sur tous les autres parisiens que vous connaissez, notez chaque de 1 à 5 selon votre appréciation"*

This question seems to imply that the respondent should give a rating for each of the remaining Parisians they know (use of word 'chaque'), after in Q4 a rating is given for each of the 20% of friendliest Parisians.

To me this does not make sense for the following reasons:

- Sudden use of plural, compared to q4, verbs and adjectives (eg amicaux, font etc) could imply a general rating is required.
- No reason to split q4 and q5, might as well combine and ask for an individual rating for all Parisians respondent knows. There would be no difference in the data, but perhaps this would be to help break up the survey from the user's perspective, or so two questions can be weighted differently.
- Scoring 80% of Parisians respondent knows could be a lot of individual ratings if they know 50+ would be 40 ratings! This might be a bit laborious.

I took this question at face value and took it to mean what it seems to imply; individual rating for each of 80%.

Survey 3
--------

In both questions in this survey it says the following:

*"Dans le camembert graphique suivant, saisissez la proportion de chaque qualité que vous associez à un parisien"*

This implies that the fields listed below each question must all fit into one pie chart. I think this makes it difficult to extract any meaningful data from this survey as the different fields are NOT mutually exclusive.

For example a respondent might give this response for q1.

- friendly: 10%
- happy: 30%
- warm: 30%
- generous: 30%

This might seem like the respondent thought Parisians were not very friendly, but in reality it may just be that they think Parisians are happy, warm and generous **more** than they are friendly, but still think Parisians are very friendly.

Personally, I think this creates a lot of unneccessary ambiguity in the data and I would consider restructuring the survey.
