Brief
-----

Below is what I understand the brief to be. There were a few places where I was unsure of the wording, I have detailed this in the clarification section.

To create a REST API that captures survery responses from 3 different questionares from the L'association Française de Réputation des Parisiens Émigrés. It should also allow accessing and ammending captured repsonses. The API will deliver JSON via HTTP.
